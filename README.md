# Context Diagram extension for capellambse

This extension of [py-capellambse](https://github.com/dbinfrago/py-capellambse) enables generation of views (diagrams) that describe an element context (from a user-defined perspective). This allows systems engineers to do less layouting work and at the same time get diagrams with optimal layouts into the model-derived documents.

The contents of an element context (what elements make it to the context) depend on the element of interest and are selected based on a hand-picked set of rules. However in many cases end user can further customize what and how needs to be in the context view.

The generated views are delivered as SVG images and do not persist in the model itself. This approach enables generation of large number of views at scale (in parallel) in the document production pipeline and also saves quite some XML space in the models. When you rely on generated views for documentation the models can stay lite as they only need to have the engineering / design views (that dont need to have a nice layout).

The layout work is done by [elkjs'](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) Layered algorithm.

## Generate **Context Diagrams** from your model data!

When the extension is installed you get additional method `.context_diagram` available on those model elements that are already covered by context view definitions.

### Simple context

![Context diagram of **Left**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbinfrago/capellambse-context-diagrams/main/docs/assets/images/ContextDiagram%20of%20Left.svg "Context diagram of **Left**")

### Interface context

![Interface context diagram of **Interface**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbinfrago/capellambse-context-diagrams/main/docs/assets/images/Interface%20Context%20of%20Interface.svg "Interface context diagram of **Interface**")

Have a look at our [documentation](https://capellambse-context-diagrams.readthedocs.io/) to get started and see the capabilities of this extension.
